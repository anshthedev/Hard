# **Space Station - 2024 STEAM Olympics Hackathon**
**About**: *this was my winning submission for the hard level into the 2024 STEAM Olympics Hackathon*

## Hackathon Project Description:

In this assignment, you'll manage a virtual space station and its crewmates. Your task is to develop a system that allows you to control various aspects of the space station, from assigning crewmates to modules to piloting exciting space missions! 
You must be able to add more crewmates and modules to the console. The code needs to ask the user to add crewmates and/or modules. You also need to be able to land spaceships on your station. Spaceships need a pilot and a crew.
Once those requirements have been met, you must make it run on a locally functioning webpage. The webpage also needs to be visually appealing. 

## Code Overview:

I created a task manager for the space station with the functionality to land and fly the space station using buttons. Then there was a list of crew members with the names listed in an organized format with the options to remove and add quantities of crewmates. Underneath the list of crewmates, there was an input field taken from the user to assign user-inputted tasks to selected crewmates. When assigned the task would pile up in the task section where a countdown would start until the task was finished. When a task was being done, the crewmate assigned to the task was also disabled from being assigned to any other task. Lastly, there was an option for the user to setup an agenda for future missions.

## Techinal

### Frontend:

The frontend of the website was handled through the webpage.html and style.css using the languages HTML and CSS to setup the webpages in an organized layout and having css to make it pretty.

### Backend:

The backend of the website was handled through index.js where the functionality of countdowns, adding crewmates, removing crewmates, assigning tasks, and more were all implemented.
